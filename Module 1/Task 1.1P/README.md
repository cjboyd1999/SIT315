# SIT315 - Task 1.1P
### Build a Simple Sense-Think-Act Board

In this task, I created a sense-think-act system using the following components:
- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x Small breadboard
- 1 x Green LED
- 1 x 250Î© resistor
- 1 x TMP36 temperature sensor

The system works by detecting if the temperature is greater than 30 degrees Celsius. If it is, the green LED turns on, otherwise it will turn/remain off.

The project can be copied and simulated on Tinkercad using [this](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gaporabekgS) link.

This project was based on codebender_cc's "How to Use the TMP36 Temp Sensor - Arduino Tutorial" on Instructables which can be viewed [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-use-the-TMP36-temp-sensor-Arduino-Tutorial/).
