# SIT315 - Task 1.1P
### Build a Simple Sense-Think-Act Board

In this task, I created a sense-think-act system using the following components:
- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x Small breadboard
- 1 x Red LED
- 1 x 250Î© resistor
- 1 x PIR Sensor

The system works by detecting if there is active movement within the sensor's range. If there is, the green LED turns on, otherwise it will turn/remain off.

Additionally, the serial monitor outputs the current status of detected/undected motion and whether the LED is currently on or off.
